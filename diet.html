      <h1>My Diet</h1>

      <p>
	I have a rather eclectic diet, due to the aggressive and hungry
	bacteria that have decided to camp out in my small
	intestine. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to figure out what they
	really like to eat, and avoid eating that. I'm on my own personal
	version of the low FODMAP diet, which (if you're curious) you can go
	google lots about. It boils down to avoiding fructose, lactose,
	sugar alcohols, and something in garlic/onions. 
      </p>

      <p>
	If you're here because you want to cook something I can eat, remember
	that I'm not allergic to any foods. It's just that some bacteria in my
	gut really love to devour certain things, so I try not to feed them. A
	little bit of anything is fine, and you don't need to worry about any
	kind of cross contamination. The only things that tend to sneak in are
	onion and garlic, but a tiny amount that accidentally got added won't
	be that bad. Further, if I eat something I shouldn't, the worst that
	happens is that I don't feel great for a day. You can't kill me by
	feeding me the wrong thing.
      </p>

      <p>
	Anyway, here're some good and bad food lists for me.

      <h1>Helpful Tips and Common Pitfalls</h1>
      <ul>
	<li> High Fructose Corn Syrup hides in everything. Read the ingredients of everything. Especially bread: so many otherwise normal looking breads contain High Fructose Corn Syrup.
	<li> "Spices" is a tricky entry on an ingredients list. According to the FDA, foods manufactured in the US cannot include onions or garlic in "spices". However, imported foods are not subject to this restriction. Thus, "spices" is safe as long as the food is manufactured domestically, but potentially unsafe if the food is imported.
	<li> "Flavorings" and "Natural Flavorings" can contain onion or garlic, according to the FDA, and are thus to be avoided.
	<li> I'm not allergic to anything, so a tiny bit of anything is OK. No need to fret about contamination. Further, if it's easy to pick around, that's fine too. If you cook a large tasty thing with big chunks of onion, I can pick around them and that works fine for me.
	<li> The parts of garlic and onion that give me issues are the garlic and onion flesh. I have special oil manufactured by Fody Foods which contains garlic or onion flavor. Most garlic or onion flavored oils (including those you make at home) are not safe for me, but the oils made by Fody Foods are safe.
