      <h1>My Diet</h1>

      <p>
        I used to have a rather eclectic diet. Over the last few years I've
        been gradually reintroducing foods, to the point that I can eat almost
        anything with no consequences. The one that still gets me is onions: a 
        large amount of onions will still give me some trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to cook for me, feed me whatever you want. If you want to 
        help me stay healthy, try to keep the saturated fat under 6 grams per meal.
