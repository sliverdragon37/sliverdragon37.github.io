          If you've found yourself here, you are considering getting us a gift. Please don't feel any
          obligation, we will be totally fine and aren't relying on gifts. You being in our lives is vastly
          more important to us than any physical gift. That said, we've picked out a few things that would
		be useful to us. </p>
	<p>We also ask you to be mindful of your carbon emissions with respect to any baby related celebrations
         or activities, and consider capturing your carbon emissions by using our preferred direct carbon capture
		provider <a href="https://climeworks.com/checkout/cart?customizer=true">Climeworks</a>
